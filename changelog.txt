Version 0.1.8 (15 December 2008)

Added in file settings.txt "show new function under test".
Added several interface roughness models, see file interface.txt.
Added eV and cm-1 visualization in addition to wavelength.




Version 0.1.7 (3 October 2006)

Added in file settings.txt default incidence angle and 
lower transmission limit for absorption calculation.
Now the model for rough interfaces works for any incidence angle.




Version 0.1.6 (19 April 2006)

Added the possibility to define the rms roughness of the interfaces.
So far it works only for normal incidence.
If rough interfaces are used then only the specular components of 
R, T, A etc. are computed.




Version 0.1.5 (9 November 2005)

Some minor bugs have been fixed




Version 0.1.4 (30 June 2005)

Added Psi and Delta calculation (Pseudo Dielectric Function)

Now clicking on the plot one gets x and y coordinates (wavelength and %)




Version 0.1.3 (25 May 2005)

in file settings.txt the field separator has changed, now the comma is used. 
This was necessary to allow path including spaces.

Added the absorption coefficient (Alpha) calculation and the 
energy Gap evaluation (Tauc's Plot).

Added the Energy Flux Profile calculation.




Version 0.1.2 (5 May 2005)

First public release
